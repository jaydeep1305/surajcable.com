  /**
   * Retrieves a list of GlobalForwardingRule resources available to the specified

   *
   * @param string $project Project ID for this request.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string filter Sets a filter {expression} for filtering listed
   * resources. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name
   * comparison_string literal_string.
   *
   * The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic
   * field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string
   * must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the
   * string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of
   * field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the
   * literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The
   * literal value must match the entire field.
   *
   * For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-
   * instance, you would use name ne example-instance.
   *
   * You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances
   * that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on
   * nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
   * based on label values.
   *
   * To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
   * parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-
   * central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning
   * that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
   * @opt_param string maxResults The maximum number of results per page that
   * should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than
   * maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get
   * the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0
   * to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
   * @opt_param string orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default,
   * results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
   *
   * You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
   * using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
   * creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).
   * Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is
   * returned first.
   *
   * Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
   * @opt_param string pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to
   * the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of
   * results.
